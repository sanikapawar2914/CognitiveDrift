COGNITIVE DRIFT - AI POWERED COGNITIVE STABILITY SYSTEM
Team Name: ALGOZEN Team Leader: Sayali Pawar Track: [Student Track] AI for Learning and Developer Productivity 


PROJECT OVERVIEW
CognitiveDrift is an AI-powered cognitive stability system designed to improve learning and developer productivity by analyzing thinking patterns over time. Unlike traditional tools that focus on output metrics or stress, CognitiveDrift monitors the quality of reasoning to detect gradual declines in decision clarity and idea diversity.


CORE INNOVATION: THE CSI
The platform generates a Cognitive Stability Index (CSI). This index serves as a measurable indicator that helps users maintain deep thinking, avoid cognitive overload, and make better decisions while solving complex problems.


KEY FEATURES

Real-time Cognitive Stability Score: Live tracking of mental clarity and reasoning stability.

Idea Diversity Analyzer: Detects reduced range or variety in problem-solving approaches.

Repetition Pattern Detection: Identifies circular thinking or stagnant reasoning behavior.

Early Warning Alerts: Immediate notifications triggered before performance quality significantly drops.


Weekly Cognitive Reports: Comprehensive trend graphs for long-term tracking and insights.

Privacy-first Design: Ethical and privacy-first AI principles integrated into the data handling core.


TECHNICAL ECOSYSTEM

AI Model Integration: AWS Bedrock for high-fidelity language analysis and model hosting.


Language Engine: NLP Processing focused on reasoning depth and signal detection.


Backend Services: Python and FastAPI for high-performance, asynchronous API delivery.


Frontend Interface: React Dashboard for real-time visualization and user feedback.


Data Storage: PostgreSQL for secure management of historical cognitive scores.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The system follows a layered architecture designed to convert raw user interactions into actionable cognitive insights:

User Input Layer: Interfaces with the user to collect interaction and behavior data.

NLP Analysis Engine: The central processor for language signals and reasoning depth.

Signal Detection Models: Dedicated modules for detecting specific cognitive indicators.

CSI Calculation Module: Logic engine that translates NLP signals into the numerical Stability Index.

Notification and Dashboard Layer: Visualizes findings through CSI Score Meters and Insight Panels.
