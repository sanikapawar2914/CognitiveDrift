# Requirements Specification: CognitiveDrift

## 1. Project Overview
**CognitiveDrift** is an AI-powered cognitive stability system designed to improve learning and developer productivity by analyzing thinking patterns over time. It identifies declines in reasoning quality and idea diversity to prevent cognitive overload.

## 2. Target Audience
* Developers solving complex problems.
* Students and lifelong learners.
* Professionals engaged in deep-work tasks.

## 3. Functional Requirements
**Real-time CSI Scoring:** Generate a Cognitive Stability Index (CSI) based on user interaction[cite: 17, 36].
**Pattern Analysis:** Detect repetitive thinking and reduced idea diversity[cite: 27, 46].
**Alert System:** Provide early warning alerts when cognitive drift is detected[cite: 39].
**Reporting:** Generate weekly cognitive reports for long-term tracking[cite: 42].
**Hesitation Tracking:** Monitor interaction patterns to identify decision-making friction[cite: 41].

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
**Privacy-First:** Secure, encrypted data handling to ensure user thinking patterns remain private[cite: 31, 43].
**Latency:** Real-time feedback must be provided with minimal delay to remain relevant to the current task[cite: 45].
**Scalability:** Built on AWS infrastructure to support growing user interaction data[cite: 100].

## 5. Success Metrics
* Accuracy in detecting repetitive reasoning patterns.
* User retention and engagement with weekly reports.
* Reduction in "decision fatigue" reported by users.
